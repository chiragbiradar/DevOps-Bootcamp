# Bootcamp Tools - Installations

Welcome to the Bootcamp Tools Installations guide! In this guide, we will walk you through the essential tools you need to have installed to kick off your devops bootcamp journey. We understand that setting up a development environment can be quite daunting, but we've got you covered. 

## Here are the tools you need to install:


### Package Managers: Homebrew, Chocolatey
Package managers are essential tools for any developer, and in this bootcamp, we will be using Homebrew for macOS (or Linux) and Chocolatey for Windows. With these package managers, you can install many other tools we will be using throughout the bootcamp. So, we recommend installing them right at the beginning of your journey.

To install Homebrew for macOS or Linux, visit https://brew.sh/. 

For Windows users, I recommend installing Chocolatey, which you can download from https://chocolatey.org/. 

Linux users already have the apt-get or yum package manager readily available. 

If you prefer, you can also use Brew on Windows 10/11. Check out this guide for more information: https://medium.com/@edwardbaeg9/using-homebrew-on-windows-10-withwindows-subsystem-for-linux-wsl-c7f1792f88b3.

### Code Editor: Visual Studio Code
The next tool you need to install is a code editor, and we recommend Visual Studio Code. It is a powerful and versatile code editor that supports many programming languages, and it has an active community that regularly updates it with new features. You can download it from https://code.visualstudio.com/download. 

Alternatively, you can use IntelliJ IDEA, which you can download from https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/. You will need these editors for build tools, package manager, and afterwards.

### Git CLI
Git is a popular version control system that you will be using in this bootcamp. We recommend installing the Git command-line tool, which you can download from https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git. Windows users can also download Git Bash from https://gitforwindows.org/. You will need this tool for Version Control with Git and afterwards.



### Java - OpenJDK
Java is a popular programming language, and OpenJDK is the open-source version of the Java Development Kit. You will need it for Build Tools & Package Manager and afterwards.

Docker and Docker-Compose
Docker is a containerization platform that allows you to package and run your applications in a consistent, isolated environment. Docker-Compose is a tool that allows you to define and run multi-container Docker applications. You will need these tools for Containers with Docker and afterwards.

To install Docker and Docker-Compose, follow these links:

Docker: https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/
Docker-Compose: https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/

We hope this guide has been helpful to you as you set up your devops environment. If you encounter any issues during the installation process, create a issue we will discuss and try to solve it.

### Good Luck!
